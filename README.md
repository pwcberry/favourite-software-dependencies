# My Favourite Software Dependencies

Contemporary software development would not be without dependencies. You could write a simple "hello world" program without relying on another person's code. However, if you want JSON output... then you would need to involve code from another source creating a dependency.

A dependency could be a framework, or a library or a package that's found in a language's source code ecosystem. The following lists are those that I find very useful.

## JavaScript

- [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter): Parse front-matter from a string or file
- [@js-joda/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-joda/core)

## TypeScript

- [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin)

## Python

- [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/): an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages

## C#

- [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/): a high-performance JSON framework


## Java



## Scala
