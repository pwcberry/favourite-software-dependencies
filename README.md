# My Favourite Software Dependencies.

Contemporary software development would not be without dependencies. You could write a simple "hello world" program without relying on another person's code. However, if you want JSON output... then you would need to involve code from another source creating a dependency.

A dependency could be a framework, or a library or a package that's found in a language's source code ecosystem. The following lists are those that I find very useful.

## JavaScript



## TypeScript



## Python



## C#



## Java



## Scala
